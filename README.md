# 4-BIT PARALLEL ADDER CMOS
CMOS vs PSEUDO NMOS LOGIC Comparison

## Introduction
This project involves the design and implementation of a 4-bit parallel adder using both CMOS and pseudo-NMOS logic. The objective is to compare the rise time, fall time, area, and power consumption of the two designs. The project includes simulation and analysis of these metrics to provide a comprehensive comparison.

## Features
